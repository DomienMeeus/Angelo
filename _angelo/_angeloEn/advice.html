      <h1 class="center">A FEW HANDY TIPS</h1>
      <p class="intro center"> When you have found the hair extensions you like the most, you obviously want to have the best care for them. After all, nothing stays forever. However, if you give the hair extensions the right care, they will last so much longer! Here are a few useful tips and tricks to enjoy your Angelo Brazilian Hair extensions as long as possible.</p>
</div>


<div id="bgAdvies">
 

<h2 class="center">Hand-Made Wefts</h2>
<p class="justify">• Never cut any part of the top of the wefts. These wefts are hand-tied and delicate. If they are cut, then we can not guarantee that they will not shed.<br><br>

• Never sew through the top of the weft. Although we are the only company to triple-reinforce our wefts, putting a needle through the weft will damage the wefts and cause shedding.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="center">Straight Hair</h2><br>
<h3 class="center">Maintenance</h3>

<p class="justify">Shampoo at least once a week
• Use a shampoo no higher than pH 7.<br><br>
• Dilute one ounce of shampoo in a bowl or jug with a pint of warm water
• Sponge the shampoo into the hair
• Do not massage
• Rinse thoroughly
• Apply conditioner and comb hair, starting with the ends working your way up to your scalp
• Do not rinse all of the conditioner out of your hair
• Let air-dry.</p><br>

<h3 class="center">Daily care</h3>

<p class="justify">Brush or comb through to style
• Use styling aids, such as mousse, gel, and hairspray in moderation (preferably alcohol free products).</p><br/>

<h3 class="center">Sleep</h3>

<p>Before going to bed, braid your hair into one loose large braid at the back of the neck.
After waking up, undo braid and comb through, beginning at the ends and working your way up to roots.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="center">NATURAL CURLY HAIR</h2><br>
<h3 class="center">Maintenance</h3>

<p class="justify">Do not use oil products on permed hair, it can cause matting
• Do not brush or comb hair when dry, it will cause frizz and the ends may tangle
• Shampoo at least once a week
• Use a shampoo no higher than pH 7
• Dilute one ounce of shampoo in a bowl or jug with a pint of warm water
• Sponge the shampoo into the hair
• Do not massage
• Rinse thoroughly
• Apply conditioner and comb hair, starting with the ends working your way up to your scalp
• Do not rinse all of the conditioner out of your hair
• Scrunch up hair gently to reform curl
• Let air-dry
• Style as desired.</p><br>


<h3 class="center">Sleep</h3>

<p>Before going to bed, braid your hair into one loose large braid at the back of the neck
• After waking up, undo braid
• Wet hair with water
• Comb through beginning at the ends and working your way up to roots
• Scrunch up hair gently to reform curl
• Let hair air-dry
• Style as desired.<br><br>

<h2 class="center">SPECIFIC CONDITIONS</h2><br>
<h3 class="center">Static</h3>

<p>In colder months, you may experience some static. The best way to deal with this is to wet your hands with water, and rub hand together so they are warm. Run the palms of your hands over your hair, without actually touching your hair. This process should help control the static.</p><br>

<h3 class="center">Swimming</h3>

<p class="justify">It is not recommended that you swim with extension hair. However if you do, the following precautions are recommended
• Never wear a swimming cap or anything that covers your hair, the friction may cause matting
• Before swimming comb out tangles
• Braid hair into one braid at back of neck
• Try to keep head above water, do not swim under water, no diving
• After swimming keep head out of shower
• Immediately after showering undo braid, comb hair and let air-dry
• Follow with appropriate shampooing and conditioning as needed.</p><br>

<h3 class="center">Sauna</h3>

<p>Braid hair into one braid at back of neck
• The water of the sauna will penetrate the hair and wet it
• Do not wrap hair in towel, which will compress it
• After sauna keep head out of shower
• Immediately after showering undo braid, comb hair and let air-dry
• Follow with appropriate shampooing and conditioning as needed</p><br>

<h3 class="center">Sunbathing</h3>

<p>Braid hair into one braid at back of neck
• After sunbathing do not unbraid until hair has cooled down
• Undo braid, comb hair
• Follow with appropriate shampooing and conditioning as needed.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="center">MISCELLANEOUS TIPS</h2>
<p class="justify">• Although the extension hair is real, it is not receiving nutrients from the scalp like your own hair. Heat is your hair extensions’ biggest enemy. The more you use on it, the shorter the life span of your hair. We cannot guarantee that the hair will remain silky if you use the blow dry, flat iron, or curling iron.<br><br>

• When you sleep, we highly recommend that you braid, wrap or ponytail your hair together to prevent tangling. This will save time that would be spent untangling the hair the next morning.<br><br>

• When washing the hair, always wash it in a downward motion. Use your fingers in a horizontal motion between wefts to clean your scalp. When rinsing, do the same to be sure that all residues of shampoo and conditioner are washed out.<br><br>

• If you perm, tint, bleach or cellophane the hair, you do it at your own risk. We do not guarantee any hair that has been chemically altered. If you must chemically alter it, then be sure to do a test strand first. This will allow you to test how the hair will hold up to the chemicals.</p><br><br><br><br>
